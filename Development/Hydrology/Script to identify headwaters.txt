#Identifying headwater streams given the problem with false heads
###First step is to identify headwaters as those that are not in the 'nextdown' column of the table
headwaters=network[which(!(network$HydroID %in% network$NextDownID)),]


###Second step is to remove all the 'false heads'

dup_nodes=network$From_Node[duplicated(network$From_Node)]    
dup_nodes=unique(dup_nodes)                                            # list limited now to unique vales for duplicate from nodes

headwaters_2=headwaters[which(!(headwaters$From_Node %in% dup_nodes)),]    

##Third step is to merge data with annual runoff
headwaterIDs=headwaters_2[,c(2,9)]

colnames(Annualmean)[1]="SegmentNo"

Head_water_runoff=merge(headwaterIDs,Annualmean,by='SegmentNo')

###Finally id max
max(Head_water_runoff$RUNANNMEAN)

Head_water_runoff[which(Head_water_runoff$RUNANNMEAN==88932.7),]


#####Trying it with From and to nodes

###First step is to identify headwaters as those that are not in the to_node column of the table
headwaters=network[which(!(network$From_node %in% network$To_node)),]
